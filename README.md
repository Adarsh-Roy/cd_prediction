# Drag Coefficient Prediction App

This project is a web application that predicts the drag coefficient (Cd) of a vehicle based on its 3D point cloud data. The application is built with Streamlit and served using Docker.

## Quickstart: Running the Application

The fastest way to get the application running is with Docker and Docker Compose.

### Prerequisites

*   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
*   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd cd_prediction
    ```

2.  **Build and run the container:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

3.  **Open the application:**

    Once the container is running, open your web browser and navigate to:
    [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

## How to Use the App

1.  **Upload a file:** Use the file uploader to select a point cloud file. The application supports both `.pcd` and `.paddle_tensor` formats.
2.  **View the prediction:** The application will process the file and display the predicted drag coefficient (Cd) value.

## For Developers: Model Training

This repository is a monorepo containing both the Streamlit application and the complete code for model training and experimentation.
